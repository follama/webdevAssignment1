ANALYSIS

This assignment faced me with the task of creating a website for my hometown’s tourist association. The end users of the task are those wanting to visit and also convincing people why they should visit.
Requirements specification:
The project required each page to include 4 pages with responsive bootstrap features, this was to show all the features that we had learnt so far and apply them with html, css and bootstrap.
Index:  A banner with the town’s name, motto and when it was founded
Home: General information about the town and a static map 
Visit: Details on places to visit and essential experiences for tourists in a 7:5 structure with bootstrap features to show information
History: Background information about the town’s past.

Boundaries: 
The website must be at least 4 pages including the index, home, visit and the history of the town and all pages must be design-validated 
Utilising an image editor to select colours for CSS backgrounds and borders.
Write creative descriptions for the town, its history, and essential experiences, including images and external links where appropriate.

DESIGN

My website is in a webbed structure, meaning that you can go from one page to another freely without following a certain order. This is because starting from the index page the user is given the choice to go between whichever page they feel inclined to, including the page that they are currently on.

Although the user is given free choice when it comes to which page they want to go to and fro from, the navbar is actually put in the recommended order for the user to have the most seamless flow when browsing the website. The index, then the home page about where Lagos is, a bit more about the history of Lagos and then places to visit

SinceI chose to cover Lagos, Nigeria as that's my home town. I immediately drew inspiration from the Nigerian flag which if you are unaware, is green white green. I decided to incorporate elements of green throughout my whole website. This can be seen from the very first page (index) where I put the colours of the flag behind the text itself to mimic it, I did this using the span tags to put the colours I wanted behind the specific text. I also outlined all of my text with black to stand out against the background, especially the "to" as it's already against a white background and the font colour is white. The black border around the text helps to distinguish the two. 
I decided to use the Google font Orbitron and Anta to be eye-catching while also applying what I had learnt from my tutorials. I also used the quote tags from the tutorials to distinguish the motto for the city as well. I also wanted to show a glimpse of the bustling city, and I did so by getting an image of it and using it as my background for the index page, I wanted a blurred effect on it and found a way to do that through w3schools. I made the background of all my pages have a very pale green, and also made the deeper greens to border my images on the visit page to make the images stand out.
 I made the navigation incorporate a deep green to match the flag and also made the links in the navigation consistent by putting them in the same order throughout my website so that you don't get confused about where each link is.
I also made sure that the map and images were always separated from the text to distinguish the two and made sure they didn’t overlap.
Every image on my website also leads to more information when clicked on, with the image on the visit page even highlighting when hovered over.

CHALLENGES FACED

For my navigation, I hadn't read the requirements for them and I had just made a normal navbar, not realising that I needed to include bootstrap responsiveness. Used w3schools and found out it had to be inside the body instead
When I did incorporate Bootstrap it stopped showing some of my CSS like my imported google fonts correctly. I fixed this by putting my external css link AFTER the link I used for my bootstrap and also one just before the end of the closing body tag
The map wasn’t displaying on my page but I found out that needed an api for the map to load and once I included that then it began to work.
I could add git commits but I struggled with pushing them
I struggled with the best layout of my images on the visit page as I had a div class for a picture and a thumbnail but I managed to fix it by looking into my css
 I struggled with changing the font size for the paragraphs on the history page as I wanted more information on the page displayed in a very legible way. I used a left and right class and text aligning in my css to help

In conclusion, the bootstrap part of the website was harder for me to incorporate into my website as I hadn’t done it before and no tutorial really covered it. I had to make up for my lack of knowledge using the slides but also google. Anywhere else I was stuck I referenced in my html and css using the commenting feature. I mainly relied on w3schools.
