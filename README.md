For my project, I chose to cover Lagos, Nigeria as that's my home town. I immediately drew inspiration from the Nigerian flag which if you are unaware, is green white green. I decided to incorporate elements of green throughout my whole website. This can be seen from the very first page (index) where I put the colours of the flag behind the text itself to mimic it, I did this using the span tags to put the colours I wanted behind the specific text. I also outlined all of my text with black to stand out against the background, especially the "to" as it's already against a white background and the font colour is white. The black border around the text helps to distinguish the two. I decided to use the Google font Orbitron and Anta to be eye-catching while also applying what I had learnt from my tutorials. I also used the quote tags from the tutorials to distinguish the motto for the city as well. I also wanted to show a glimpse of the bustling city, and I did so by getting an image of it and using it as my background, I wanted a blurred effect on it and found a way to do that through w3schools.
(ref: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_blurred_background.asp)
I made the background of all my pages have a very pale green, which had a little bit of white n t and also made the deeper greens on the page stand out.
I made the navigation incorporate a deep green to match the flag and also made the links in the navigation consistent by putting them in the same order throughout my website so that you don't get confused about where each link is.

CHALLENGE 1 - For my navigation, I hadn't read the requirements for them and I had just made a normal navbar, not realising that I needed to include bootstrap responsiveness.
